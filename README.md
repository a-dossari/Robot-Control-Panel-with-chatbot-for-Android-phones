# Create robot control panel application with chatbot.

I created a web page in HTML format containing a control panel (controller) for the robot and chabot, then I created a mobile application linked to the web page to control the robot using the phone.

As you can see in the file, there are options to control the movement of the robot, which are: forward, backward, right, left, and stop. Also, there is a speak button for chatbot.


Chatbot will only recognize certain sentences (you can add more), which are:

- Hi

- Hello

- How are you

- How do you do

- Thank you 

- Thanks

- Bye

- Good bye
